# Convertible-Staircase-lift
The present work investigates the design the and analysis of a stair case lift, which can
be use as Material Handling System. A stair case lift is a mechanical device for lifting people
and wheelchairs up and down on the stairs, who may find difficulty in doing so themselves.
For sufficiently wide stairs, a rail is mounted to the treads of the stairs. A chair or lifting
platform is attached to the rail. A person on the chair or platform is lifted as the chair or platform
moves along the rail, old age and goods are to be carried across the stair case. Stair case lift is
a type of lift that can be mounted on the stair case without altering civil structure. This lift runs
on electric power and consists of a motor, reduction gear box, rope drive, two rails and a sliding
chair. In this system we use DC motor for changing the polarity of the power supply which will
make the motor run in reverse direction. Advantages over the conventional hydraulic lift are
no civil structure and alteration is required, low cost, less bulkiness, less power, less
maintenance requires. Easy design, easy installations can be of industrial use too. Moreover,
considering some drawbacks due to weight carrying capacity completely depend upon the
capacity of motor. There is lot of scope for further modification in the project as using monorail
instead of two, use of belt drive or chain drive instead of rope drive, Incorporation and
automation/ timer unit which will ease the use of device. Rack and carrier arrangement for
using the device for curved stair case and use of work & roller reduction gear assembly.

Key words: Platform, Rails, Wire rope drive, AC motor, civil structure.
